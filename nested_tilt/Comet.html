		     <p>&quot;Comet&quot;By Robert Fellows; Sheet Version: 6.1; Release Date: 05-20-04; Updated: 07-04-07

			Overview

			It is easy to have fun while playing this game. It is a good Family Game Room addition. Comet is the hit of every party I have. It has a fun and fairly easy Rule Set and can be enjoyed by just about everyone, although drinking moderately seems to help one's gratification with playing the game and its associated frustrations.

			NOTE: These rules are compiled from hours of playing of "Comet" and are as accurate as possible to the author's best knowledge.</p>
		     
		     <p>STARTING THE GAME</p>

		     <p>One to four players can play. New players can enter the game by pressing START until the end of the ball of the last player. After that, pressing START aborts the current game for all players and begins a new one.</p>

		     <p>PLAYFIELD LAYOUT</p>
		     
		     <p>Starting from the lower playfield and working up here is a description of the Playfield and Game:

			Flippers: There are 2 of them, located just above the Outhole. There is a small post with a rubber O-Ring in between the flippers. There is a "Ride Again" light at the Outhole.

			Left Hand Return lane: It is normal size, for games of that time. The left return lane lights the Cycle Jump Ramp. There is no right hand Return Lane.</p>
		     
		     <p>OUTLANES</p>

		     <p>Both of the Outlanes have "SPECIAL" lights on them. The Left Outlane advances the Duck bonus by 3 and the Right Outlane advances the Rabbit bonus by 3. The left Outlane can also return the ball to the playfield if the ball hits the Outlane bumper in the right place, English helps here. Both Outlanes activate the Train Whistle when the ball drains... you'll learn to hate that sound.</p>

		     <p> DUCK TARGETS</p>
		     		     
		     <p>Just above the left outlane are 4 Duck targets and hitting all four lights the Corkscrew.

			Rabbit targets: Just above the right outlane are 4 Rabbit targets and hitting all four lights the Funhouse.</p>
		     
		     <p>COMET RAMP</P>

			<P>Right in the middle of the playfield is a ramp. This is the Comet ramp, and it returns the ball to the lower right playfield. You can re-light it, activating larger scoring potential, by hitting all of both the Duck & Rabbit targets to the left and right of the playfield. If you do not hit the ball hard enough to make it all the way around, it will fall back down onto the center of the playfield and sometimes even SDTM (Straight Down the Middle).</p>
		     
		     <p>FUNHOUSE</p>
		     
		     <p>Just to the right of the Comet ramp, there is an Eject hole, called the Funhouse.

			Cycle Jump Ramp: In the upper right corner of the playfield, above the Funhouse, is the Cycle ramp.

			Pop Bumpers: 3 of them, just below the top rollover lanes and behind the Comet ramp.

			Corkscrew Ramp: In the upper left corner of the playfield is the Corkscrew ramp.

			TOP LANES 1-9-8-6: At the top center are the 1-9-8-6 rollover lanes.

			Backglass: Comet has nice artwork. There is a roller coaster (The Comet) with John Belushi in the back seat and Jane Curtin in the second row on the left; well it sure looks like them!</p>
		     
		     <p> PLAYFIELD ADJUSTMENTS</p>
		     
		     <p>The playfield has a few physical adjustments that change the difficulty of game play: playfield pitch, playfield level & post position. While these are discussed on pages 8 & 9 of the Owners Manual, I'll highlight them here.

			Playfield Pitch & Level are set by the front and rear leg levelers on the bottom of the machines legs. The nominal pitch (front to back) setting should be about 6 degrees. The playfield should be level (side to side) when measured at both the top and bottom areas of the playfield.

			There are 5 posts at the Return lane and the Outlanes that can be adjusted. These adjustments make the game play "conservative" (easier to lose the ball) to "liberal" (more difficult to lose the ball). In general, opening up the Return lane makes the game more liberal (harder to lose the ball) and opening up the Outlanes makes the game more conservative (easier to lose the ball). These adjustments are detailed on page 8 of the Owners Manual.</p>
		     
		     
		     <p>GAMEPLAY</p>

		     <p>One should start out with the skill shot, shooting the ball into the area above the rollover lane and allowing it to pass thru one of the lanes. From there, the ball goes into the Pop Bumpers, and can come out either side of the Comet ramp. If you shoot the ball too hard, the ball will just exit the rollover lanes area, via the Corkscrew, and head towards the flippers.</p>

		     <p>DUNK THE DUMMY</P> 

			<P>Hitting the "DUMMY" drop target exposes the bull's-eye for a timed interval. Hitting bull's-eye, before the drop target resets, advances bonus multiplier (Green playfield light): 1st time: 2x; 2nd time: 3x, 3rd time: 4x; 4th time: 5x... thereafter, hits score 20,000 for each additional time. Hitting the "DUMMY" activates a game voice.</p>

		     <p>General Playfield Points:</P> 
			The following is in addition to the scoring shown above. The Left Return Lane scores 5,000. The left and right Outlanes score 10,000. The left Outlane scores the Duck Bonus and the right Outlane scores the Rabbit Bonus. Hitting the Ducks and Rabbits scores 2,000 the first time and 1,000 after that. The Funhouse scores 10,000, the COMET ramp (unlit) 10,000. The Corkscrew scores 20,000. The 3 Pop Bumpers score 1000 per activation.</p>

<!-- 		     <p>MAXIMUM CREDITS</p>
 -->
		     <p>OTHER SOUNDS</P>
			<P>The game plays this addictive music that gets stuck in your head!

			When a ball has scored a large amount of points, the machine awards you with flashing backglass lights and the sounds of fireworks; and if you score the 1,000,000 point shot, the machine also flashes all the machine's lights and makes more fireworks and roller coaster sounds.

			The train whistle (left & right Outlanes) and the Cycle Jump Ramp drum roll are equally annoyingly cool sounds! Each player also has different music for their 1st ball.

			Comet also makes noise in Attract Mode- and it can be annoying in a quiet house, when the machine yells "Hey Turkey".</p>

<!-- 		     <p>Lock Saucer</p>
 -->		     
		    <!--  <p>Since the "Shoot again" light stops blinking well before the end of the multi-ball ball-saver, I have found the best way to judge the expiration of the ball-save is to listen to the music. The music has an ABAC pattern, and the multi-save ends around the start of the C [for Time Machine, it's the ominous slow notes; don't know how best to describe other modes].</p>
