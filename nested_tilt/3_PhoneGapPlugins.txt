My app that I would like to continue building is called Tilt. It’s a pinball rule sheet app and allows users to scroll through different machines and view the rules on how to play each game.

PhoneGap Plugins

1. I will definitely use the camera plugin. I want users to be able to take pictures of high scores, machines, and locations and be able to upload them.

2. My second choice is “Social Sharing.” People not only want to play pinball but they would like to have the ability to share content to their social media.

3. Having a keyboard is essential. I will like to add a magnifying icon to allow users to search for a pinball machine. The keyboard will come into use by allowing the user to simply type their desired machine.
