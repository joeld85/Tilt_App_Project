			Overview

			It is easy to have fun while playing this game. It is a good Family Game Room addition. Comet is the hit of every party I have. It has a fun and fairly easy Rule Set and can be enjoyed by just about everyone, although drinking moderately seems to help one's gratification with playing the game and its associated frustrations.

			NOTE: These rules are compiled from hours of playing of "Comet" and are as accurate as possible to the author's best knowledge.</p>
		     
		     <p>STARTING THE GAME</p>

		     <p>PLAYFIELD TOUR
				
				Clockwise from the flippers:

				BALL SAVE POST - raised by hitting the Death drop target, this post
				times out with the sounding of four "gongs". Yes, you can still drain
				around the post, if your flipper work is bad enough.

				SLINGSHOT - scores 10 points, as does its partner.

				"RAISE DEATH" INLANE - scores 10; when lit, raises the Death drop
				target; feeds the left flipper.

				"2X LOIS" INLANE - scores 10; when lit (alternating with the "2X MEG"
				inlane, switched by either sling), doubles the value of the Lois
				Spinner shot for a brief time; feeds the left flipper.

				"NOT SPECIAL" OUTLANE - scores 10; when lit, awards an extra ball.

				"MEG" TARGET - scores the "Meg" value in certain modes, along with
				100K for the first hit of each ball, increasing by 15K with each
				additional shot, to the pleasant accompaniment of Meg's screams and
				whimpers; lights the Pirate target.

				"CHRIS" TARGET (LEFT ORBIT) - scores the "Chris" value in certain
				modes, along with 100K for the first hit of each ball, increasing by
				10K with each additional shot. The shot does not "orbit", but returns
				back down the left side to the flippers, and (in most cases) drops
				the Evil Monkey target and advances its value, and lights the Evil
				Monkey Jackpot for a short time.

				"DEATH" DROP TARGET - scores 200K for the first hit of each ball,
				increasing by 25K for each additional hit; raises the ball saver post
				for a short period of time. Up at the start of each game.

				"F-A-R-T" DROP TARGET BANK - scores 750 for each target dropped. When
				completed, reduces the number of "DROP TARGET HITS TO START
				MULTIBALL" shown above the right flipper by one; completing the count
				starts Fart Multiball (see below). The lowest ("F") target is also
				lit for "SKILL SHOT" at the start of each ball; hitting it when lit
				scores 500K the first time in each game, increasing by 250K each
				additional time the Skill Shot is made.

				RAMP - scores 5,510 for the first shot of each game, increasing by
				500 for each additional shot. Increases the ramp count; reaching
				indicated numbers lights the upper captive ball for Extra Ball. The
				Evil Monkey target drops in front of this ramp; hitting it (whether
				or not the ramp shot is completed) scores the sum of the point lights
				flashing in front of the ramp, and/or starts Crazy Chris mode, if
				that light is flashing. The ramp also lights the Drunken Clam saucer
				and advances the pop bumper values; it feeds the lower left flipper
				via the "2X LOIS" inlane.

				"PETER" ("X-X-X") TARGET BANK - scores 10 for each target dropped.
				When completed, scores a "Peter" value in certain modes, and advances
				the end of ball bonus multiplier, to a maximum of 5X. The first
				completion of each ball scores 100K, increasing by 20K with each
				additional completion to a maximum of 250K.

				"BRIAN" BEER CAN - scores 10; advances toward the Beer Can awards
				(see below).

				BUMPERS - one under Peter (red, scores 220 per hit), one tucked under
				the mini playfield (white, scores 220 per hit), and a third one
				directly behind Brian (blue, scores 520 per hit). Increased in value
				by successive ramp shots: the first increases the white bumper to 520
				per hit, the second increases the red bumper to 520 per hit, and the
				third triggers Quagmire quotes with each bumper hit. Hitting any
				bumper rotates both the currently selected Beer Can mode and TV mode
				through the remaining unplayed modes.

				"DRUNKEN CLAM" ("MYSTERY") SAUCER - scores 10; when lit, scores a
				"randomly" selected value (see below). Lit at the start of each ball;
				ejects into the bumpers.

				"STEWIE'S MINI-PINBALL" - a separate mini playfield, complete with
				its own mini flippers and pinball. There are five scoring shots on
				the playfield (from left to right):

				  BRIAN (left orbit)
				  MEG (standup target)
				  PETER (standup target)
				  LOIS (ramp, feeding left mini flipper)
				  CHRIS (right orbit)

				There are also inlanes on both sides of the playfield, feeding their
				respective mini flippers; the mini ball is placed into play by being
				shot up the right inlane.

				Completing all the character shots on the mini playfield starts
				Stewie Multiball. The mini playfield shots also add points to the
				Jackpot value for Sperm Attack.

				"EVIL MONKEY JACKPOT" LANE - when lit, the first Evil Monkey Jackpot
				of each ball scores 500K, increasing by 50K with each additional
				Jackpot; the Jackpot light is timed, so a lucky bounce and a skillful
				shot can score two EM Jackpots from one lighting. When not lit, the
				first shot of each ball through the lane scores 250K, increasing by
				25K with each additional shot to a maximum of 500K. The lane can also
				be lit for Super Jackpot, and is also the secret Skill Shot; hitting
				this lane when "SKILL SHOT" is lit scores double the current Skill
				Shot value, and increases the next Skill Shot award by 250K. The lane
				passes under the Stewie playfield, feeding the right orbit.

				"STEWIE" TARGETS - when lit, score the "Stewie" value in certain
				modes. Between modes, score 100K for the first hit of each ball,
				increasing by 10K with each additional hit, and add 1 second to the
				starting time for the next round of Stewie Pinball (which starts at
				15 seconds).

				UPPER CAPTIVE BALL - scores 11,040; adds a letter to "P-I-N-B-A-L-L".
				This shot is also lit for a Jackpot in certain modes, and for Extra
				Ball, and is the second half of the "PINBALL COMBO", beginning with
				either orbit shot. The Combo value starts at 500K, and increases by
				50K for each additional combo hit; a combo starting with the right
				orbit (Lois) scores the full Combo value, while a combo starting with
				the left orbit (Chris) scores half the current Combo value.

				"PIRATE" TARGET - scores 10; when lit, scores a "random" Pirate value
				(see below).

				SCOOP - when not lit, scores a random number of points, between 20K
				and 120K. When lit (in order of priority): "MULTIBALL" starts Sperm
				Attack, "P-I-N-B-A-L-L" starts Stewie Pinball (on the mini
				playfield), and "TV" starts the flashing TV mode (or TV Wizard mode).
				The scoop ejects to the right flipper.

				LOWER CAPTIVE BALL - scores 11040; adds a letter to "P-I-N-B-A-L-L".
				This shot is also lit for a Jackpot in certain modes.

				"LOIS" SPINNER (RIGHT ORBIT) - when lit, scores the "Lois" value in
				certain modes; hitting the Spinner also advances toward lighting "TV"
				on the scoop. The first spinner rotation of each ball scores 1K,
				increasing by 50 with each additional rotation to a maximum of 5K.
				Completing the right orbit shot exits the left orbit (like the return
				from a Chris shot).

				"SPECIAL" OUTLANE - scores 10; when lit, awards a Special.

				"2X MEG" INLANE - scores 10; when lit (alternating with the "2X LOIS"
				inlane, switched by either sling), doubles the value of the Meg shot
				for a brief time; feeds the right flipper.



				BEER CAN MODES
				--------------

				The currently selected (flashing) Beer Can mode is rotated through
				the remaining unplayed modes by hitting any of the three bumpers.
				Hitting the Beer Can the indicated number of times (starting at 5,
				and increasing by 1 after each award) awards the currently flashing
				value:

				"COLLECT BEERS" - scores 24,570 (12K prior to "v11.0") per Beer Can
				hit so far in the game. This mode does not appear to score any points
				whatsoever if it's the last of the five Beer Can modes collected, but
				it still does.

				"GIGGITY GIGGITY" - advances the pop bumpers to their maximum point
				values.

				"HAPPY HOUR" - for 20 seconds, doubles the value of all scores.

				"REMEMBER WHEN" - starts a Jackpot shot at a randomly selected
				character, which counts down from a starting value of 3M (increasing
				by 1M with each additional "REMEMBER WHEN" mode) to a minimum of
				750K, and then times out. Hitting the selected character scores the
				current value.

				"LARD MULTIBALL" - 2-ball multiball with a generous ball saver, with
				six Jackpot shots (Meg, Chris, Brian, Lois, and both captive balls).
				The first Lard Multiball Jackpot of each game scores 250K, increasing
				by 100K with each additional Jackpot, to a maximum of 750K. Each
				Jackpot hit also resets the countdown timer to 10 seconds; if the
				countdown timer expires, one of the already hit Jackpots is relit.
				Collecting all six of the lit Jackpots at the same time turns off the
				countdown timer, and lights the Evil Monkey Jackpot lane for Super
				Jackpot, which scores 3M, and restarts the mode. Lard Multiball ends
				when only one ball remains on the playfield.

				When all five Beer Can modes are completed, they reset, and can all
				be awarded again.



				TV MODES
				--------

				The currently selected (flashing) TV mode is rotated through the
				remaining unplayed modes by hitting any of the three bumpers. Hitting
				the Lois Spinner the indicated number of times (starting at 10, and
				increasing by 5 after each award, to a maximum of 30) lights the
				scoop to start a TV mode. When "TV" is lit, hitting the scoop scores
				500K and starts the currently flashing mode:

				"GOOD OLD BOYS" ("SHOOT SIDE SHOTS AND RAMP FOR BIG POINTS") - for 30
				seconds, each of these lit shots scores 500K, increasing by 100K with
				each additional shot, to a maximum of 1M per shot.

				"SUPER GRIFFINS" - within 30 seconds, hit each of the 6 characters
				once to activate their super powers. The first character hit scores
				750K, increasing by 50K for each additional character hit, up to 1M
				for the final character. Hitting all 6 character shots also scores a
				1M bonus, for a total mode maximum of 6.75M.

				"CHICKEN FIGHT" - every playfield switch made scores a "hit" on the
				chicken, who randomly hits Peter back. When one of the "life" bars
				under the Peter or the chicken on the DMD reaches "KO", the mode
				ends; either "PETER WINS" or "CHICKEN WINS" is displayed, along with
				the total number of points scored during the mode. There appears to
				be a point bonus (value unknown) for winning the fight.

				"SEXY PARTY" - for 30 seconds, "any shot" (Meg, Chris, Stewie, Lois,
				or the ramp) scores 300K points, increasing by 50K each time the
				Stewie targets are hit, to a maximum of 750K.

				"IPECAC CONTEST" ("SHOOT PETER, BRIAN, CHRIS AND STEWIE. MORE PEOPLE
				SCORES MORE POINTS!") - for 30 seconds, each of these 4 character
				shots score points depending on the total number of different
				characters hit during the course of the mode, as follows:</p>
