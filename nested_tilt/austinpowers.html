		     <p>&quot;Austin Powers&quot; Rulesheet for Austin Powers - Stern

			Version 0.99 - 2 March 2003
			Author: David Gersic
			Updates by: "supercat" Disclaimer: Austin Powers is copyrighted and trademarked by somebody.</p>
		     
		     <p>Playfield Layout:</p>

		     <p>As always, starting at the bottom and working clockwise.</p>

		     <p>LASER CANON</p>
		     
		     <p>Along the top, left edge of the score card apron is a moving ball launcher. Balls are fed in from the left ramp. When enabled, the canon swings out to aim up the playfield. There is a "Fire" button on the lock down bar to fire the canon at the designated shot.</p>
		     
		     <p>FLIPPERS</p>

		     <p>Two standard flippers, right about where you'd expect to find them.
			Left Inlane
			A normal inlane. The left ramp dumps the ball here if it is not fed to the Laser Canon. Has the "H" of "S-H-A-G".
			Left Outlane
			A normal outlane. Has the "S" of "S-H-A-G".
			MOJO Standups
			Two standup targets.</p>

		     <p>MINI ME</p>
		     		     
		     <p>A spinner with a plastic "Mini Me" figurine on it in place of the usual paddle. It is counterweighted and spins well when hit. This is at the entrance to the Left Loop, which leads all the way around to the Right.</p>
		     
		     <p>Loop.
			Fat Bastard Ramp
			A short ramp leading to a toilet seat with Fat Bastard. The ball exits the toilet to the "Mini Me" lane to its left.
			Big Frickin' Laser
			The left ramp. Loops around behind Fat Bastard, down past Mini Me, and exits to the Laser Canon or the Left Inlane.</p>
		     
		     <p>LEFT STANDUP</p>
		     
		     <p>A small standup target at the left side of the entrance to the Time Machine ramp. Goes "beep" when you hit it.</p>
		     
		     <p>TIME MACHINE</p>
		     
		     <p>Right in the centre of the playfield, there is a short ramp that leads up to a spinning disk with a pinball sized hole in the middle. Shots to this toy are stopped, then released out the back in to the Loop and returns via the Mini Me spinner.</p>
		     
		     
		     <p>RIGHT STANDUP</p>

		     <p>A small standup target at the right side of the entrance to the Time Machine ramp. Goes "beep" when you hit it.</p>

		     <p>DR. EVIL </P> 
			A motor driven (up/down) target shaped like the good doctor. When up, hit him with the ball to score ???. Comes up briefly at the beginning of ball, to show you that he's there.
			Rollover Lanes / Skillshot
			Two rollover lanes. At the beginning of a ball, one will be lit to collect the skillshot (Bonux 6X).</p>

		     <p>Pop Bumpers</P> 
			Three. What's to say? They're pop bumpers.
			Austin Powers Hole
			A scoop beneath a large Austin figure. Drop the ball in the scoop and watch Austin spin. Has playfield lights leading up to it for ???.
			Right Ramp
			??? Loops around the back, then down the right side and exits to the Right Inlane.
			Right Loop
			???
			Right Outlane
			A normal outlane. Has the "G" of "S-H-A-G".
			Right Inlane
			A normal inlane. The Right Ramp dumps the ball here. Has the "A" of "S-H-A-G".
			Ball Plunger
			A combo-plunger. The player uses the manual plunger. The game can auto-launch balls to start multiball, ball savers, etc.</p>

<!-- 		     <p>MAXIMUM CREDITS</p>
 -->
		     <p>Ball Savers</P>
			The game includes two ball-savers in addition to the very long ball-savers on multi-ball. If the ball drains immediately after SCORING the time-machine (it must be an eligible target) during single-ball play, the machine will try once to relaunch it (if the relaunch attempt fails, you lose). Also, if you start the SHAG Hurryup with an outlane during single-ball play you'll get the ball back. Note that for that to work the system must recognize that you are in single-ball play. Being in two-ball play and having both balls go down opposite outlanes simultaneously starting the hurry-up does not qualify.</p>

<!-- 		     <p>Lock Saucer</p>
 -->		     
		     <p>Since the "Shoot again" light stops blinking well before the end of the multi-ball ball-saver, I have found the best way to judge the expiration of the ball-save is to listen to the music. The music has an ABAC pattern, and the multi-save ends around the start of the C [for Time Machine, it's the ominous slow notes; don't know how best to describe other modes].</p>
