		<div class="rules">

		     <p>&quot;The Addams Family&quot; Version 2.0.
			Last revised January 27, 1995.
			Compiled and written by Brian Dominy.
			Introduction</p>
		     
		     <p>Starting the Game</p>
		     
		     <p>This information is provided for newcomers to pinball who may be unfamiliar with the machines. Insert coins into the machine to accumulate credits. The display will show the number of credits you've put on the game. Press Start once for each player in the game; you may play up to four players at once, and you may add players until the beginning of ball 2. Do not press Start thereafter until all players have finished their games; otherwise, all players' games will be aborted and a new, one-player game will start.</p>
		     
		     <p>On the newer Addams Family Gold Edition, you may buy an extra ball at the end of the game for 1 credit. All game features and scores resume as they were at the end of the game.</p>

		     <p>General Playfield Description and Basic Rules</p>
		     		     
		     <p>This section contains the basic game rules, shot by shot. Specific rules about timed rounds, multiball, and other major game features will come later.</p>
		     
		     <p>Million Plus Ramp (Side Ramp): 
			Each left ramp shot scores 1M, 2M, 3M, etc. up to a maximum of 10M*; this value resets at the beginning of each ball. Each shot also lights a letter in THING if THING has not yet been completed, spots the first unlit GRAVE target, lights the electric chair, and feeds the ball (with a properly working diverter) to Thing's Flipper. This ramp is also used to collect Stars when lit via the left loop, and to score Super Jackpots during multiball. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130 points in both directions and loudly fires the ramp diverter.</p>
		     
		     <!-- <p>SEQUENCE FEATURE</p> -->
		     
		     <p>Bear Kick Ramp (Center Ramp): 
			Each center ramp shot awards 1 Bear Kick (2 when lit via the near left inlane), lights the Electric Chair if it is not lit, and returns the ball down the right inlane. When Thing Flips is lit, it sends the ball to Thing's flipper instead. Extra balls and free mansion rooms are awarded at various numbers of bear kicks. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130 points in both directions. It is also the "V" grave target. See "Bear Kicks".</p>
		     
<!-- 		     <p>FEATURE SCORE INCREASE AND SPECIAL SCORING</p>
 -->		     
		     <p>Electric Chair (Left Sinkhole/Kickout): 
			Located just above the left flipper. When the yellow lamp is lit, it awards the currently flashing Mansion Room and kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the left flipper. When the red lamp is lit, it begins Multi-Ball(TM). The right inlane lights the chair for a mansion room temporarily; either the center ramp or the left ramp lights it permanently. On normal settings, the Electric Chair is lit at the beginning of each ball. (Note: for the remainder of the rules sheet, to say that the "electric chair is lit" means that the yellow lamp above the electric chair is lit.)</p>
		     
		     
<!-- 		     <p>REPLAYS FOR HIGH SCORES</p>
 -->
		     <p>Swamp Kickout (Right Sinkhole/Kickout): 
			Awards mansion rooms whenever the Electric Chair ordinarily would (i.e. the yellow lamp is lit). Kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the right flipper. This shot is also the "E" target in GRAVE. Shots to the vault, Thing's box, and the swamp are fed here.</p>

		     <p>Swamp (Side Wide Sinkhole): 
			Located along the right side of the playfield, just below the upper right flipper. Scores the Graveyard Value during normal play, or five times the Graveyard Value when lit by sending the ball through the opto just below the mini-flipper. The swamp locks balls when lit. Balls exit the swamp through the swamp kickout.</p>

		     <p>Train Wreck Target (Back Left Corner Target): 
			This shot is most easily made from the upper right flipper. Located to the right of the Million Plus Ramp, it scores 1M ordinarily; at certain levels, it scores 5M and a "Train Wreck". Each Train Wreck prevents the Graveyard Value from resetting at the beginning of the next ball. On normal settings, four Train Wrecks lights an extra ball. The first Train Wreck takes 2 hits; the second takes 3 hits; and so on up to a maximum of 6 hits per train wreck.</p>

<!-- 		     <p>MAXIMUM CREDITS</p>
 -->
		     <p>Graveyard Jet Bumpers: 
			Advances the Graveyard Value by 10K for unlit bumpers, 20K for lit bumpers, and 30K for flashing bumpers. Bumpers are advanced by any of the unlit GRAVE targets (see below). The Graveyard value is initially 1M at the beginning of each ball (unless it has been held by a Train Wreck), and increases to a maximum of 4M. Each jet bumper hit also changes the currently flashing mansion room, moving from left to right first, then bottom to</p>

<!-- 		     <p>Lock Saucer</p>
 -->		     
		     <p>GRAVE targets: 
			The two targets "G" and "R" are located just beneath the jet bumpers. "A" is to the left of the Bear Kicks Ramp. "V" is not a standup target but instead is the center ramp. Likewise, "E" is the swamp kickout entrance. Complete GRAVE to score the GRAVE bonus of 2M, 3M, 4M, etc. to a maximum of 10M for the duration of the game. Each unlit GRAVE target also advances a jet bumper. Any shot to the Million Plus ramp will spot the first unlit GRAVE target.</p>
