		     <p>&quot;Freddy-A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;By Robert Fellows; Sheet Version: 6.1; Release Date: 05-20-04; Updated: 07-04-07

			Overview

			It is easy to have fun while playing this game. It is a good Family Game Room addition. Comet is the hit of every party I have. It has a fun and fairly easy Rule Set and can be enjoyed by just about everyone, although drinking moderately seems to help one's gratification with playing the game and its associated frustrations.

			NOTE: These rules are compiled from hours of playing of "Comet" and are as accurate as possible to the author's best knowledge.</p>
		     
		     <p>STARTING THE GAME</p>

		     <p>During any nightmare, the player attempts to defeat Freddy Krueger by shooting any of the flashing "FREDDY" shots. Each shot increments the Freddy Meter billboard. Completing this meter qualifies the boiler shot. Making the qualified boiler shot defeats freddy, awards ten million points times nightmare number and returns the player to the "awake" state unless multiball is still in play. If multiball play is still active, then the jackpot shots are qualified.

			While the player is awake, they can earn items which can help them out during any nightmare. These items are multiball, extra power, and set alarm. If multiball is earned, then the nightmare begins with automatic multiball play. If more power is earned, then during the next nightmare, each Freddy shot increments the Freddy Meter three places instead of the usual two. If set alarm is earned, then five seconds before the end of the nightmare, the boiler shot is qualified to grab Freddy. If the player grabs Freddy, then the nightmare continues into the awake state. During any nightmare with multiball, the lower left target flashes to add an additional ball.

			Final Nightmare:

			This round always begins with four ball multiball. If the player has not completed all of the shots when multiball ends, then they are given a grace period to complete the shots. The player must complete five strobing shots to qualify the boiler room. If the player successfully completes all five shots and then completes the boiler shot, they defeat Freddy and receive the following awards:

			Collect 1,000,000 points for each soul.
			Collect 1,000,000 points for each Kruegerand.
			Collect 10,000,000 points for each Freddy defeated up to this point.
			Multiball Jackpots:

			If the player is in multiball when any Freddy is defeated, then the five jackpot lamps flash. Each shot awards the player the jackpot value and turns off the corresponding lamp. This continues until the player reaches the last shot which continues to remain active. The last shot switches to the captive ball.

			Dream Warriors

			This is a multiball mode where shooting the strobing shot awards super jackpot. Completing a strobing shot changes the strobing shot to another location. This continues until the shot is the upper left spot target which remains active. This feature lasts until the player leaves multiball.

			Hidden Mode:

			This is a multiball where each boiler shot awards 10,000,000 points. This feature lasts until the player leaves multiball. Only one hidden mode per player is allowed.

			Kruegerand Multiball:

			This is a multiball where each boiler door shot awards 5 kruegerands. This feature lasts until the player leaves multiball.

			Souls Saved:

			Various features award "Souls" to the player. These Souls are a bonus which may be collected at a later time. If the player exceeds high souls to date, they enter their initials.

			Kruegerands:

			Various features award "Kruegerands" to the player. These Kruegerands are a bonus which may be traded for items or collected at a later time.

			Claw Save:

			Completing C-L-A-W allows player to activate the claw save device between the flippers. Once this device is activated, the letters in C-L-A-W are reset.

			"Take That" (Top L. Target)

			During the awake state, if the average game is less than three minutes, this target lights kick save. If the kick save is already lit, then claw save is lit. If the claw save is already lit, then enable the hurry up extra ball. If the player has already won two hurry up extra balls, then score 20m instead. If the average game time is greater than three minutes, then the first award = 5M, second = 10M and the third = hurry up extra ball.

			Glove Flipper:

			This device is positioned near the lower left up kicker. If the player has this device qualified when the ball enters this up kicker, then the player is allowed to flip the ball off of the ramp using this device. If the player flips the ball into the captive ball, they receive an award.

			Low Game Special:

			If the payer begins the last ball with less than 20,000,000 then the right outlane special will be lit for a timed period. (see game adjustments)

			1... 2... (MYSTERY):

			Sleep/Awake Meter:

			This a vertical billboard positioned in the upper center of playfield. This meter is active while the player is "Awake". Time increments this meter toward "Asleep". If the player completes a "Coffee" shot, this meter is incremented toward the top. If this meter reaches the bottom, the player enters the next nightmare. If this meter reaches the top, then the player is "Fully Awake" and the captive ball is strobed and Hidden Mode is qualified. If the player shoots the center left spot target while fully awake, then they are awarded the Hidden Mode. If the player hits the captive ball spot target while fully awake, then they are awarded "Freddy's Bones" feature.
