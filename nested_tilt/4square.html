		<div class="rules">

		     <p>&quot;4 Square&quot; Written by Tim Meighan
			"4 Square" was released by D. Gottlieb and Co. in 1971. More information is available from the Internet Pinball Database.</p>
		     
		     <p>GAME ELEMENTS</p>
		     
		     <p>The 4 Square playfield includes two sets of targets and three sets of rollovers, with each set consisting of four items. Each item in a given set has a corresponding indicator light marked with a unique number value: 1, 2, 3, or 4. The upper central area of the playfield also contains three pop bumpers arranged in a triangle configuration. There are also two kicking rubber islands located along each side just above the flippers. The lower central portion of the playfield is wide open and contains four rows of sequence indicator lights, with each row consisting of 4 lights numbered from 1 to 4.</p>
		     
		     <p>SCORING</p>
		     
		     <p>All rollovers and targets score 50 points. During the game, certain sets of targets and rollovers may be increased in value to score 200 points instead of 50 points, as explained below. Rollover and target scoring occurs whether the item is lit or not. The two kicking rubbers score 1 point. The left and right pop bumpers score 1 point when unlit and 10 points when lit. The central pop bumper scores 10 points when unlit and 100 points when lit. The three bumpers are never all lit at the same time. The bumpers alternate between having both 10 point bumpers lit and the 100 point bumper out, or the 100 point bumper lit and both 10 point bumpers out. This alternation occurs when 1 point is scored. Therefore, the bumpers will alternate when either kicking rubber is hit or when either 10 point bumper is hit when not lit. Note, however, that once the 10 point bumpers are lit all three bumpers are scoring 10 points so none of the bumpers can cause the lights to alternate again. In this situation, the player must hit a kicking rubber to get the bumper lights to switch back so that the 100 point bumper lights up and the 10 point bumpers go out.</p>
		     
		     <p>SEQUENCE FEATURE</p>
		     
		     <p>At the start of a game, all sequence indicator lights are out and all target and rollover indicator lights are lit. The basic idea of the game is to complete as many sequences as possible (starting with the first sequence) by hitting the 1, 2, 3 and 4 targets or rollovers. When any lit target or rollover is made, the indicators of all like-numbered items go out and the corresponding number is spotted (lit) in the row of the first sequence. Numbers can be made in any order. When all four numbers in the first sequence are made, 500 points are scored and all targets and rollovers reset, lighting up again. This same action is repeated to complete the second, third, and fourth sequences in order, with a 500 point bonus being scored each time a sequence is completed. Once the fourth sequence is completed, the targets and rollovers do not reset - in other words, they do not light up again. However, they do continue to register their current score value.</p>
		     
		     <p>FEATURE SCORE INCREASE AND SPECIAL SCORING</p>
		     
		     <p>After the first sequence is completed, the top rollovers score 200 points. After the second sequence is completed, the yellow targets in the upper area of the playfield score 200 points. After the third sequence is completed, the green targets in the lower area of the playfield score 200 points. After the fourth sequence is completed, the green targets light occasionally for special. The specials for all four green targets light up together and go out together. They light whenever the 100 point bumper is lit. In other words, they are tied to the same alternator sequence as described for the bumpers. As explained above, this means that the only way to light the specials (if they are out) is to bounce the ball off one of the kicking rubbers. Hitting any green target when lit for special scores a special only (no score). Each special awards one free game (replay).</p>
		     
		     
		     <p>REPLAYS FOR HIGH SCORES</p>

		     <p>One replay is scored for achieving the each of the following high scores: 5100; 6300; 7500; 8700.</p>

		     <p>TILT</p>

		     <p>A tilt ends the game and causes ALL playfield lamps to go out.</p>

		     <p>MAXIMUM CREDITS</p>

		     <p>All Gottlieb wedgeheads were factory-set to allow a maximum of 15 credits to be registered on the replay unit. While this could be adjusted by the operator, it was extremely rare for anyone to change it.</p>

		     <p>Lock Saucer</p>
		     <p>This is placed between the left ramp and the bumpers. It has walls on both sides, so a ball has almost no chance of falling in here by accident. Shoot here to lock balls, and collect an extra ball when lit. Balls are kicked up and on to a habitrail that feeds the left inlane.</p>
