		     <p>&quot;IIndiana Jones&quot;By Robert Fellows; Sheet Version: 6.1; Release Date: 05-20-04; Updated: 07-04-07

			Overview

			It is easy to have fun while playing this game. It is a good Family Game Room addition. Comet is the hit of every party I have. It has a fun and fairly easy Rule Set and can be enjoyed by just about everyone, although drinking moderately seems to help one's gratification with playing the game and its associated frustrations.

			NOTE: These rules are compiled from hours of playing of "Comet" and are as accurate as possible to the author's best knowledge.</p>
		     
		     <p>STARTING THE GAME</p>

		     <p>Playfield Layout

			Note that this is a widebody machine of the same proportions as The Twilight Zone. I will only state briefly what is there for now, more detail will be contained in the description of play. Starting from the left flipper and going anti-clockwise things on the playfield are as follows:

			Left Inlane/Outlane
			The inlane lights Hand of Fate when lit and Special can be scored from the outlane when lit. As is common with most current machines the outlane can be adjusted but nowhere near as far as on TZ.
			A-D-V Targets
			A group of three stand up targets - the first of three such groups which spell out the word ADVENTURE.
			Left Orbit
			Depending on the mode the player is in, a shot around here will either continue around and feed back to the right flipper, or be stopped by a gate at the top of the playfield.
			Mode Saucer
			Just to the right of the orbit is a short (2") tunnel with a saucer at the end. This is where Modes, the Hand of Fate and Extra Ball are collected when lit.
			ADVENTURE Playfield
			The Indiana Jones equivalent of TZ's Battle the Power, this is a raised section of playfield which can be tilted left or right by the flippers to guide the ball over some of the 8 rollovers and collect The Pit or Extra Ball. It takes at least two shots to the upper playfield to score all the rollovers.
			Beta cabinets have metal walls on this section - production ones have red plastic walls.
			Left Ramp
			Fairly steep ramp feeding to the left inlane via a habitrail. Used extensively by the Modes and to light the Jackpot shot in Multi-Ball.
			E-N-T Targets
			Three drop targets spelling the ENT bit of ADVENTURE. Between them, they cover a Raise Jackpot target and the entrance to the Lock/Hurry Up.
			Raise Jackpot
			A small target located behind the E-N drop targets used during Multi-Ball, Dogfight and others.
			Lock & Hurry Up
			A sinkhole located behind the E-N-T targets which can be shot with just the 'T' down.
			Pop Bumpers
			The traditional triangular arrangement of 3 situated behind the sinkhole and under the left ramp. The ball can be fired up back through the I-N-D-Y rollovers or leave down from the left orbit or down from the Captive Ball.
			I-N-D-Y Rollovers
			Behind the Pop Bumpers. Spell INDY to advance Bonus X and light a Friend. Lit rollovers can be moved left/right by the flippers.
			Captive Ball
			A lane just to the right of the 'T' leads to a single drop target which protects the captive ball. Hit the ball for Quick Multi-Ball and Super Jackpot.
			Note: The Captive Ball has two switches, one at the front and one at the back. The one at the back generally awards higher points but not much else.
			Right Ramp
			Another steep one. Used a lot by the Modes and can be lit for Jackpot and Path to Adventure. Normally feeds to the right flipper but will go to the left from Jackpot and Adventure.
			Right Orbit
			Used mainly during certain Modes. Works in the same way as the left orbit.
			U-R-E Targets
			The third group of targets making up ADVENTURE. These face opposite the A-D-V targets and are also the stand up type.
			The Idol
			Sort of like a horizontal version of FT's fishing reel, this is where up to three locked balls are kept. Balls released from this go across the right outlane to the right flipper. There is a sound effect of an elephants' trumpet before each ball is released - very useful during Multi-Ball.
			Right Inlane/Outlane
			Same as the left, the inlane lights Hand of Fate and the outlane is good for a Special when lit. The divider for these two lanes has a one-way gate at the crook which allows balls fed from the Idol to get to the flipper, and at the crook of the outlane there is a post which will give skilled players to opportunity to bounce the ball back into the inlane. It can be opened up a loooonnnggggg way though (further than TZ's left outlane!!).
			Flippers/Slingshots
			Just the two of each in the usual places - flippers are full length and apparently will stay that way as the machine is not shipped with the small ones. Also, the gap between them is quite small.
			Playfield Awards

			Skill Shot
			There ain't one ..... :)
			I-N-D-Y Rollovers
			As with most things in IJ, the INDY rollovers serve more than one purpose: increasing the bonus multiplier, lighting Indy's Friends and (of course) scoring points. Completing them increases BonusX (2x, 4x, 6x & 8x) and lights one of Indy's Friends (see Orbits: below), and relights the inlanes for Hand of Fate. Once you have reached 8x, subsequent INDY's are worth a 10M 'Maximum Bonus' award (not P-3 ROMs) but there is a twist :) At 8x, Extra Ball is also lit at the Mode Saucer. Collecting it (or a 'Max Bonus') will cause BonusX to be reset to 1x on the next ball. This is probably the easiest way to get lotsa EB's.
			Super Pops
			Enough hits on the pop bumpers will start Super Pops where all hits are worth 1M each. 75 hits is the magic number, but it is (of course) operator settable. Once lit, Super Pops is active until end of ball which could lead to monster scoring. Each successive Super Pops starts after 50 more hits than the previous one (ie 125, 175, 225 etc).
			Narrow Escape
			Scores 1M after a right outlane drain which is saved through the gate to the inlane. Second Narrow Escape is worth 2M, third 3M and so on. This value is held throughout the game and apparently has no limit (Kevin has had it up to 52M!).
			Note: The game recognises a Narrow Escape when the first rollover in the outlane is hit, but not the second. Therefor, it is quite common to score it even when you actually drain - especially when that post is open to the max. Also, it is possible to trip the outlane switch while the ball is deciding which lane it is going to go down - this will also score a Narrow Escape

			Orbits
			Left and right orbit shots are worth 1M + (2M x Lit Friends) when lit. This provides a minimum of 3M per loop since you get one free Friend lit and a max of 11M per loop. Consecutive lit loops are worth 2X, 3X, 4X the base with no known limit (7x is the highest I've heard of). If you are good at loops, you can get some pretty huge scores from lit loops .. :)
			Loop Jackpot
			This could also be called a 'Friends Jackpot' and is scored in the following manner: Light all friends from the INDY rollovers (lit Friends are denoted by a flashing light between the slingshots), shoot lit loops to light each Friend solidly (as opposed to flashing) then shoot the right ramp to collect the jackpot. Scoring is the total of all lit loops collected before the Jackpot is collected, to a maximum of 200M. The base at the start of the game is 5M. If you fail to collect the Loop Jackpot before the end of the ball when you light it, both the Friends and the Loop Jackpot value are reset (value becomes 0M).
			Note: If the right ramp is lit for Multiball jackpot and Friends jackpot, one hit will collect both but only the animation for Friends is displayed..

			Ramps
			Making a lit ramp is worth 1M and lights the alternate ramp via the inlane. Hitting alternating ramps in succession will score 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M and so on....
			Dogfight
			Shooting left and right ramps when lit will also spot a green, winged light (seen amongst the Mode lights on the playfield). Completing all six will start a Dogfight. Hurry Up is lit and counts down from 40M, shoot the sinkhole behind the E-N-T targets or the Raise Jackpot target to collect.
			Note: The countdown will not start if the T target is still standing so it is possible to score the whole 40M in the same way that you might get a 'You cheat Dr Jones', or hitting the Raise Jackpot.

			Quick Multi-Ball
			Three successful shots to the the drop target protecting the Captive Ball will cause it to stay down and the captive ball be lit for 2 ball Multi-Ball for 20 secs. During this Multi-Ball shoot the Captive Ball to collect items. Drop target hits are worth 1M, 2M, 3M for the three hits. There are five items which can be collected from the Captive Ball during Quick Two Ball Multiball as follows:
			The Idol of The Incas (10M)
			The Diamond of Shanghai (15M)
			The Remains of Nurhachi (20M)
			The Cross of Coronado (25M)
			The Fish of Tayles (30M)
			Each subsequent hit is worth a 40M 'All Treasures Collected' score with the first of these lighting the outlanes for Special. If you do not get all the treasures on the first 2-Ball, they remain spotted next time you get the Quick Two Ball.

			Note: A good solid hit on the Captive Ball which causes the back switch to close adds an extra 10M to the above values. This is also sometimes called the Totem Multiball.

			During Quick Multi-Ball, all values on the Path of Adventure are doubled. I don't know if this includes the Pit value.

			The Hand of Fate
			Lit from the inlanes and scored by hitting the Mode saucer. Lighting the inlanes is done by collecting INDY. If it is not collected at the saucer within a certain time it will timeout. The inlanes start out lit for 'Light Hand of Fate' at the beginning of each ball.
			The animation is similar to the Mystery award on WhiteWater and is displayed twice - first showing a list of 4 awards and then choosing and awarding one of them. The list of 4 is selected from a larger list which includes:

			10M points, 20M points, Lite Extra Ball, Eternal Life,
			Quick Multi-Ball, Bonus X, Dogfight, Loop Person,
			Lock Ball, Lite Path , Super Pops.
			Notes: Loop Person spots one of Indy's friends, and the Eternal Life timer is operator settable. Lock Ball will increment the count of balls locked regardless of whether there are balls in the Idol or not.

			If Light Extra Ball is on the list of 4, it is always the one which is awarded for some strange reason.

			Path of Adventure
			The letters from the word ADVENTURE can be spotted in on of two ways: either a direct hit on the corresponding target, or a hit on any of the three groups (ADV, ENT, URE) once that group is lit which will spot the next unlit letter. To explain the latter, if you have ADV_Ent_uRe, a hit on the ADV bank will spot 'N' for you. The 'Raise Jackpot' target will spot a letter if ENT are down.
			Completing all the ADVENTURE targets lights the right ramp for Path of Adventure. When complete, shooting the right ramp gets you with the chance of playing on the raised mini-playfield. The objective here is to tilt the field left and right in an attempt to steer the ball over the lit rollovers (indicated by yellow lights) or into one of the holes (The Pit & Extra Ball). The number of lit rollovers increases by one each time you complete the Path without collecting The Pit, up to a max of 6.

			Awards are as follows: First set of rollovers completed lights Extra Ball. Subsequent completed Path's light and then raise the Pit value by 25M to a max of 150M. Each lit rollover is worth 5M with a further 1M for each time you completed ADVENTURE without actually playing PoA. (limit of 10M per rollover) Once you have collected The Pit, PoA is still lit, but now the lit rollovers are traveling (this is new for L-3) - I assume the value of The Pit is reset. Hitting the first set of traveling rollovers relights the EB hole on the raised playfield.

			Path of Adventure will remain lit until the 15 sec timer expires, or you drain. Complete ADVENTURE again to relight.

			The Modes

			It would have been nice to see these with a better definition than just Mode - some sort of big concept that they are based around. Admittedly, I can't think of anything that might fit the bill though.

			Anyway, there are 12 of them based on significant scenes from the three movies (4 modes for each movie) which are displayed in the big open space in the centre of the playfield. They are collected by hitting the Start Mode saucer which is always lit unless there is another Mode or Multi-Ball running (it needs to be - the shot is harder than TZ's Slot Machine IMHO).

			There is a 5M bonus just for starting any of the 12 Modes which are listed below in the order you would read them off the playfield:

			Castle Grunewald
			Hit the drop target, then pound away at the Captive Ball for points. Scoring is 5M, 10M & 15M for the three hits required for you to 'escape' from the castle making a total 35M (5M for starting) for the round.
			In L-5 revision, nailing the Captive Ball so that it hits the second switch doubles the score for that shot (ie 10, 20 & 30M).

			Tank Chase
			Animation of Indy on a horse chasing a tank. Orbit value starts at 15M and counts down to 5M. Each loop gets Indy a bit closer to the tank and enough of them will get him onboard to to destroy the tank for a 30M end of mode bonus.
			Note: The loop does not actually need to be completed to count. Early ROM's would count a loop if the two rollovers in the lane were hit in quick succession. Therefor you could get a loop credit from a ball leaving the pop bumpers on the left. Later revisions require that the bottom rollover be hit first.

			Three Challenges
			Shoot the right ramp for the Path to Adventure raised playfield. Challenges 1,2 & 3 are completed by hitting all lit rollovers for 10M, 20M & 30M respectively. All lit rollovers have to be hit during one pass of the Path to collect the points. This is pretty easy since they are usually in a row on one or other side of the Path (although Keefer claims to have had two next to each other on opposite sides!). The switches which are lit depends on whether The Pit has been collected or not; if not, you will have to hit 1, 2 & 3 switches for the Challenges; if it has, you will have to hit traveling lights but there is a bug here which makes it pretty useless at this point anyway (see Bugs: below)
			Choose Wisely
			Animation of the knight telling you to choose wisely. Five identical chalices are displayed, you are told which is the genuine article then you have to keep your eye on it while they are shuffled around. Then select using the flippers and choose by pulling the trigger on the gun (the plunger). Worth 5M if you blow it, 20M bonus if you get it right. Classic animation if you get it wrong ...... ;) Subsequent attempts are at different speeds and buggy (see Bugs: below).
			Monkey Brains
			Rather gross display of a monkey's head with the brain exposed to the world and steaming happily. Hitting ramps and orbits scores 8M each and allows you to eat some brain (yuk!). The animation for this mode is quite entertaining if you are that way inclined, and the BUUUURRRRRPPPP sound effect is one of my favourites. This is a timed Mode with no end of Mode bonus.
			Note: See Tank Chase note regarding loop scoring.

			Steal the Stones
			Shoot the right ramp for a chance to steal the Stones (yellow flashing lights) from the raised Path of Adventure playfield. Each stolen stone is worth 5M and there is a 20M bonus for collecting all 8.
			Second time round, the last 4 stones float and you need to hit the last 2 of these on one pass to complete the Mode.

			Escape in the Cart
			Video Mode animation of Indy going through a mine in a cart. Use the flippers to choose which way to go to avoid the barriers - make 25 correct decisions to complete the mode and escape. Scoring is 5M plus 1M for each correct turn and 10M bonus for getting half way and 30M for completion. Note that the cart gets faster and faster the more turns you make, and there are minor bugs here too (see Bugs: below).
			Survive the Rope Bridge
			Timed round in which Indy is trying to cross the bridge. Successive ramp shots will move him further along and score 10M each. Four ramps are required to get him across, and a fifth to cut the rope. An Extra Ball will be lit at the Mode saucer if you complete the round.
			Get the Idol
			The objective of this Mode is to steal the Idol by shooting the lock sinkhole. This is complicated by the ENT targets which keep resetting and getting in the way. Each reset is accompanied by a quote as follows:
			Start Mode: There's nothing to fear here.
			That's what scares me.
			First hit : Throw me the whip.
			Second hit: Throw me the Idol.
			Third hit : Give me the whip.
			Fourth hit: Adios, senor.
			After this, the targets remain down to expose the sinkhole. Scoring is 5M for 1 target, 10M for 2, and 20M for a sweep of all 3. Collecting the Idol is worth 20M, ends the Mode and locks a ball for Multiball.

			It is possible to collect the Idol while the targets still stand (ie a 'You Cheat' lock) but there is nothing special awarded for doing this.

			Streets of Cairo
			Shoot the ramps and orbits to search for Marion under boxes (she's under the one the monkey is screeching on) - 10M each if Marion is not underneath. Finding Marion alters the display to show Indy being menaced by a sword wielding Arab type - score the Mode saucer to have Indy shoot him for a 20M bonus. It is also possible to blast the Arab by pulling the trigger on the plunger although that is only worth a paltry 2M points. There is a total time for this mode, so the sooner you find Marion, the longer you get to shoot the Arab, although you can rack up some serious points by deliberately shooting the boxes she is not under (this has changed for L-6 where you can only collect each box once).
			Well of Souls
			Hectic 6 ball Multi-Ball during which successive shots to the lock sinkhole are worth 2M x balls-in-play. Balls remain locked in the sinkhole for a short time before getting thrown back into play. After six shots into the sinkhole, the ENT targets will start to reset for each hole scored making subsequent shots a lot harder - it also helps if you start this Mode with the drop targets down.
			Animation is of Indy in a room full of snakes which he torches when you hit the hole. This Mode lasts while there is more than one ball in play and thus there is no bonus for end of Mode.</p>
