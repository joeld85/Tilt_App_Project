			<h1>Batman Forever</h1>	

		<div class="rules">

		     <p>&quot;Batman Forever&quot; Sega 1995 by Scott R. Tiesma
			Version: gamma... still needs much work.
			Date: July 26, 1995
			Send all corrections and updates to me.
			Disclaimers</p>
		     
		     <p>GENERAL</p>

		     <p>BF seems to be a very well rounded game and is exciting to play. Ball movement is fast, but not uncontrollable. There are lots of shots, none of which are impossible to make, but some that are rather hard. Furthermore, the shots smoothly blend into one another. Overall, I think this game is one of the better Sega's (Data East's) to come out in a while.</p>

		     <p>JACKPOT SHOTS</p>
		     
		     <p>During Multiball the Left Ramp saves Chase and the Right Ramp saves Robin. Once completed the middle ramp is lit for Double Jackpot. Then, the batwing must be loaded (it is automatically enabled) and the ball must be shot up the mini-ramp for a Super Jackpot.

			The special is lit after collecting the Double Jackpot (I believe).

			Batwing Shots

			The shots that are lit for targeting from the batwing are:

			Mini-ramp \
			VUK |--> all pictured as a bat symbol on the DMD
			Right Ramp |
			Right Orbit /
			Three Question Mark targets: left of VUK and on both sides of right ramp entrance. --> These are pictured as "?" on the DMD
			These shots are worth 10 Million each (unless doubled)

			I haven't noticed anything special occurring upon getting all the shots from the batwing even though once a shot is completed from the batwing it doesn't show up on the DMD anymore. Hmmm?

			The Cabinet

			It is a widebody. The artwork is fantastic. Very realistic and keeping with the dark "batman mood".</p>
		     
		     <p>SKILL SHOT</p>

		     <p>Pull the trigger and collect what is displayed on the DMD. Awards I've seen are:

			25 Million
			Start Gotham Scene
			Mr. E Award
			2X Bonus
			Two-Face Pops (2 Million a pop)</p>

		     <p> BATARANGS</p>
		     		     
		     <p>A new name for the Picard Manuever from STTNG. Shoot the left orbit and then the middle ramp. There is an ego award for the most batarangs (in a row? on one ball.) i.e. you get to put in your initials. However, rarely have I seen this show during attract mode... and never during instant info.</p>
		     
		     <p>GOTHAM SCENES</P>

			<P>The Gotham Scenes are the modes for this game. They are changed via bumper hits. (Is their any other way?) However, during a mode you can't start another mode. Nor can you see what mode is lit to become next (by bumper hits). It may not even change during a mode. I haven't been able to tell yet.</p>
		     
		     <p>MULTIBALL</p>
		     
		     <p>The Wizard Award....

			It is started by matching both the good and bad heads... sighting all bat signals and having completed all gotham events. After doing so, "FOREVER" is lit to be collected via the regular Mode Start routes. The beginning is a great graphic of the riddler which I didn't get to watch very long as all the balls just started spewing out. Thus, also, I was not aware if anything else was occurring (such as Mega Pops, lit special, etc).

			This is a 4 ball multiball mode with a ? second ballsaver. The object is to load the batwing to collect jackpots. The problem is that the batwing is moving. Thus, you may hit the left ramp but if the batwing isn't in the right position - No jackpot. Really it's quite ingenious, and very fun! The mode ends when less than two balls are in play.</p>
		     
		     <p>EXTRA BALL</p>
		     
		     <p>Can be lit via:

			the Gotham Scene (Light Extra Ball),
			a Mr. E Award, or
			? some number of shots to some ramp or orbit - but I haven't solved which yet.
			When lit it is collected at the mini-ramp and Two-Face says "Live from the ???; Here's your extra ball."

			Also, an extra ball can be awarded from the Mr. E award (and possibly the video mode, though I haven't seen it there).</p>
		     
		     
		     <p>HIGH SCORES</p>

		     <p>2.4 Billion is the default Grand Champion score. My high so far (1 Buy-in) is @ 4.91 Billion for which I received 2 Credits. Previously I had set the GC with 2.8 Billion (no buy-ins) and received 3 Credits (possibly I could have imagined this... but I don't think so)! I also scored 2.7 Billion for 3rd place and 1.8 Billion for 4th place (the high score list goes to 6) but didn't get any credits. (Maybe only 1st and 2nd get credits?)</p>

		     <p>EASTER EGGS</P> 
			<P>6 player play is allowed (league type, just as in Baywatch).

			Pressing both flipper buttons simultaneously will launch the ball (if it is in the plunger lane).

			No cows so far :(</p>

		     <p>BUGS</P> 
			There is a ? loop or something champion displayed on the DMD occasionally but this can't be seen in instant info - WHY!

			Also, it would be nice to be able to see what Bat Gadgets have been collected (or need to be collected) before getting the Super Laser Kick. This could be done via instant info also.

		    <!--  <p>Since the "Shoot again" light stops blinking well before the end of the multi-ball ball-saver, I have found the best way to judge the expiration of the ball-save is to listen to the music. The music has an ABAC pattern, and the multi-save ends around the start of the C [for Time Machine, it's the ominous slow notes; don't know how best to describe other modes].</p>
